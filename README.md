# Clean-the-water

This is my first IronHack Project ! A fun and kid-firendly video game inspired by my passion for nature and obsession on plastic waste !

https://azienda-creativa.github.io/clean-the-waters/

# Description

Plastic is invading the water, BUT YOU CAN SAVE IT !

In this game you will collect plastic bottles from the water. the goal is to save the fish and gain points.
When a fish eats plastic by mistake you lose 1 point.
When you bump onto a fish is Game Over.
It gets harder every minute.
