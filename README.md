# Clean-the-waters

This is my first IronHack Project ! A fun and kid-firendly video game inspired by my passion for nature and obsession on plastic waste !

# Description

Plastic is invading the water, BUT YOU CAN SAVE IT !

In this game you will collect plastic bottles from the water, the goal is to save the fish and gain points.
When a fish eats plastic by mistake, it will die and you lose 1 point.
Also when you bump onto a fish , it wil die and you lose 2 points.
It gets harder every minute.
You lose when hitting -1 points !
